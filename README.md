tactile buttons to run internet radio box:   
Keeping It Stoopid Simple Internet Radio  allows a dedicated dumb box, housing a raspberry pi zero wireless to run a python script for playing internet radio stations.  The pi zero is controlled only by using the buttons, - each pointing to a different url, in addition to a pause button and a shutdown button.  The script will need to be started as a service on boot.  There are no other interface other than ssh and a terminal window to Keep it Stoopid Simple.
